Generic (reentrant) read-write locks.

These add functionality on top of `ConcurrentUtils`; specifically, they allow querying the status of the lock, and
querying the status of the lock. We also provide explicit `write_*` and `read_*` functions instead of relying on `lock`
to be `write_lock`. That is, [`ReentrantReadWriteLock`](@ref) is **not** an `AbstractLock`.
