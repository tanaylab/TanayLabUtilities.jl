It is good practice to contain a description of the effects of each parameter somewhere in the documentation, and it is polite to also provide its default value. This can be done in either the signature line or in the text, or both. Using DEFAULT ensures that the correct value is used in the documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"constant"},{"location":"documentation.html#TanayLabUtilities.Documentation.function_default","page":"Documentation","title":"TanayLabUtilities.Documentation.function_default","text":"function_default(func::Function, parameter::Symbol)::Contract\n\nAccess the default of a parameter of a function annotated by @documented.\n\n@documented function foo(x::Integer = 1)::Nothing\n    return nothing\nend\n\nprintln(function_default(foo, :x))\nprintln(function_default(foo, :y))\n\n# output\n\n1\nERROR: no parameter (with default): y\nexists for the function: foo\n\nfunction foo(x::Integer = 1)::Nothing\n    return nothing\nend\n\nfunction_default(foo, :x)\n\n# output\n\nERROR: not a @documented function: foo\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"documentation.html#Index","page":"Documentation","title":"Index","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"documentation.html","page":"Documentation","title":"Documentation","text":"Pages = [\"documentation.md\"]","category":"page"},{"location":"types.html#Types","page":"Types","title":"Types","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"types.html","page":"Types","title":"Types","text":"TanayLabUtilities.Types\nTanayLabUtilities.Types.Maybe\nTanayLabUtilities.Types.Unsure","category":"page"},{"location":"types.html#TanayLabUtilities.Types","page":"Types","title":"TanayLabUtilities.Types","text":"(Very) generic types.\n\nWe got sick and tired of writing Union{..., Nothing} everywhere.
